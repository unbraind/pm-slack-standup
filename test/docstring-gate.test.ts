/**
 * Behavioral coverage for the docstring gate script.
 *
 * The gate is a release gate, so a test must assert both the clean path (the
 * real repository passes) and the violation path (an undocumented declaration is
 * reported), plus the CLI entry point that writes streams and sets the exit
 * code. Every assertion runs against {@link runGate}'s returned strings or
 * captured process streams, never against the analyzer directly, so a regression
 * in the gate's own wiring surfaces here rather than only at release time.
