 * Both sides are canonicalised through `realpathSync` before comparison. A
 * launcher reaching this file through a symlink (an npm bin shim, a linked
 * workspace) would otherwise compare unequal and skip the gate silently.
 *
 * Resolving only `argv[1]` would be enough under Node's defaults, where the
 * ESM loader realpaths a module before recording `import.meta.url`. It is not
 * enough under `--preserve-symlinks`/`--preserve-symlinks-main`, which leave
 * `moduleUrl` holding the symlink while `realpathSync(entry)` resolves it.
 * The two would then compare unequal on a direct invocation and the gate would
 * exit 0 without scanning — the exact silent skip this function exists to
 * prevent, reintroduced by a runtime flag. Canonicalising both sides adds a
 * second `realpathSync` and removes the dependence on how Node was launched.
 *
 * An unresolvable `argv[1]` **propagates** rather than returning false. The two
 * outcomes are not equally safe: returning false means `npm run docstring`
 * exits 0 having scanned nothing, which is a required release check reporting
 * success without doing its job — the one failure this gate exists to prevent.
 * Letting `realpathSync` throw turns that into a loud non-zero exit. The case
 * requires `argv[1]` to stop resolving after Node has already loaded this file,
 * so in practice it means the environment is broken, and a broken environment
 * must not silently satisfy a gate.
 *
 * A genuinely different entry path still returns false, which is how a test
 * importing this module declines to run the gate.
 *
 * @param argv - The process argv to inspect.
 * @param moduleUrl - The `import.meta.url` of the module that might be main.
 * @returns True when `argv[1]` and `moduleUrl` canonicalise to the same path,
 *          false when they canonicalise to different ones.
 * @throws Whatever `realpathSync` throws when either path cannot be resolved.
